  <p> I decided to take the stock video of a racing game. Then with this video I decided to take
      more upbeat and more EDM style of music as the soundtrack so that it is more like the game
      I wanted the racing game to be like. Then I made a sound effect to match the timer at the start
      of the race. Then I made a car accelerating to match the car in the game as it accelerated. Then
      I made a "skrt" noise as if the car was skidding or breaking very hardly towards a turn. I also made
      the engine of the car rev before the start of the race, as most racers do that as a flex.</p>
